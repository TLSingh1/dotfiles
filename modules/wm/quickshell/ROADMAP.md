# Quickshell Cyberpunk Shell - Development Roadmap

## Project Vision
**An ultra-futuristic desktop shell with dynamic theming, advanced shaders, and rich data visualizations that adapts to your aesthetic while showcasing the beauty of technology.**

## Development Principles
1. **Dynamic theming is the foundation** - Everything builds on this
2. **Cyberpunk aesthetic first** - Every component should feel futuristic
3. **Features over performance** - Enable all effects by default
4. **Data is beautiful** - Integrate visualizations everywhere
5. **Smooth and reactive** - Rich animations and transitions

## Phase 0: Foundation (Week 1)
**Goal: Set up the project structure and core systems**

### Deliverables:

- [ ] Set up development environment with hot reload
- [ ] Create base QML shell entry point
- [ ] Implement basic Hyprland integration
- [ ] Set up shader development pipeline

### Technical Tasks:
```nix
# Basic module structure
modules/wm/quickshell/
├── default.nix          # NixOS module
├── packages.nix         # Package definitions
├── shell/
│   ├── main.qml        # Entry point

- [ ] All animations run at target FPS
- [ ] Multi-monitor configurations work
- [ ] Battery usage is reasonable
- [ ] All keybindings function
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] Graceful degradation

### Git Workflow:
- Branch per phase: `phase-1-theming`, `phase-2-bar`, etc.
- Daily commits with working state
- Tag each phase completion
- Maintain CHANGELOG.md

## Success Metrics
1. **Visual**: Achieves cyberpunk aesthetic consistently
2. **Performance**: Smooth 60fps with all effects enabled
3. **Functionality**: All planned features working
4. **Integration**: Seamless with existing dotfiles
5. **Stability**: No crashes in normal use
6. **User Experience**: Fast and responsive

## Risk Mitigation
- **Shader Complexity**: Start simple, enhance iteratively
- **Performance Issues**: Build profiling from day 1
- **Integration Bugs**: Test each system connection thoroughly
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to roadmap, defer extras to post-launch
