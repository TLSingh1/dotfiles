# HyprShell - Desktop Environment Shell Specification

**Note**: This document is an implementation guide for Claude AI agents working on the HyprShell project. It serves as the single source of truth for features, requirements, and implementation details.

## Vision
Build a complete desktop environment shell that transcends traditional window management, integrating AI assistance, system control, productivity tools, and entertainment into a cohesive, beautiful experience.

## Core Design Principles
1. **Unified Experience**: Single expandable control center instead of scattered panels
2. **Performance First**: Lazy loading, efficient resource usage, single instance per display
3. **Security by Default**: All credentials in system keyring, encrypted communications
4. **Holographic Aesthetic**: Glassmorphic UI with custom GLSL shaders via Hyprshade
5. **Power User Focused**: Command palette, keyboard shortcuts, deep system integration

## Available Astal Libraries
AGS/Astal provides powerful system integration libraries that significantly simplify implementation:

- **AstalNetwork**: NetworkManager integration (WiFi/Ethernet control)
- **AstalBluetooth**: Bluetooth device management
- **AstalWirePlumber**: Audio control (volume, devices, streams)
- **AstalBattery**: Battery monitoring and power management
- **AstalHyprland**: Hyprland window manager integration
- **AstalNotifd**: Notification daemon functionality
- **AstalMpris**: Media player control
- **AstalTray**: System tray integration
- **AstalApps**: Application queries and launching
- **AstalAuth**: PAM authentication
- **AstalPowerProfiles**: Power profile management
- **AstalCava**: Audio visualization

These libraries provide reactive bindings and eliminate the need for many shell commands, resulting in cleaner, more performant code.
